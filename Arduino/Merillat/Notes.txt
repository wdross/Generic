As of 11/21/2016:
- Actual state sequence machine for controlling door logic
- Alter RxTest software on Uno to respond, making a simulator
- GUI:
  - represent outputs
  - inputs
  - activate Touch functions:
    - 'screen saver' mode -- touch to wake
    - touch an Open/Close input request to start sequence

- instrumentation shows CAN messages are bunched, 5 at a time
  when redrawing line series (approx 5*90/6ms)
- to improve above, could set up ISR timer for CAN stuff???
