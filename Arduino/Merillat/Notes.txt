As of 11/28/2016, need to:
- Actual state sequence machine for controlling door logic
- Alter RxTest software on Uno to respond, making a simulator
- Also need a data logger for when tracing thruster activity
  - currently boots at 125kBaud
  - outputs data in CANKing format (thanks Pete!)
  - can request baud rate change, pause/resume (thanks Pete!)
- GUI:
  - represent outputs
  - inputs
  - activate Touch functions:
    - 'screen saver' is nothing but a black screen, to prevent burn-in
    - 'screen saver' mode -- touch to wake
    - touch an Open/Close input request to start sequence?

- instrumentation shows CAN messages are bunched, 5 at a time
  when redrawing line series (approx 5*90/6ms = 75ms to draw 4 lines)
- Simpler solution is to use MsTimer2?  Move CAN Rx/Tx into MsTimer2,
  leave GUI in loop(), which can be slow.  Already installed library...
- to improve above, could set up ISR timer for CAN stuff???
