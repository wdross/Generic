As of 11/30/2016, need to:
- Actual state sequence machine for controlling door logic
- Alter RxTest software on Uno to respond, making a simulator
  when a jumper or input is set (so no pgm change needed to just log)
- GUI:
  - represent outputs
  - inputs
  - activate Touch functions:
    - 'screen saver' is nothing but a black screen, to prevent burn-in
    - 'screen saver' mode -- touch to wake
    - touch an Open/Close input request to start sequence?

Done:
- Have a data logger for when tracing thruster activity
  - currently boots at 500kBaud
  - outputs data in CANKing format (thanks Pete!)
  - can request baud rate change, pause/resume (thanks Pete!)
- Fixed consistent timing of CAN message by using 1ms Timer2 to 
  constantly check inbound and outbound queues.  Could be improved,
  but we'll see how this goes right now.
