As of 06/28/2017, need to:
- Actual state sequence machine for controlling door logic
  - started, using StateMachine.h/cpp
- Alter RxTest software on Uno to respond, making a simulator
  when a jumper or input is set (so no pgm change needed to just log)
- GUI:
  - represent outputs
  - activate Touch functions:
    - 'screen saver' mode -- touch to wake
    - touch an Open/Close input request to start sequence?

Done:
- Have a data logger for when tracing thruster activity
  - currently boots at 500kBaud
  - outputs data in CANKing format (thanks Pete!)
  - can request baud rate change, pause/resume (thanks Pete!)
- Fixed consistent timing of CAN message by using 0.4ms FlexiTimer2 to
  constantly check inbound and outbound queues.  Test with professional
  CAN hardware showed shortest message ~0.26ms, but typically 0.44ms+,
  leading to the selection of 0.4ms timer configuration.
- Created CAN union/structures for Thruster Tx/Rx messages
- Confirmed Thruster TX byte order was as expected on the CANBus
- GUI:
  - Appears to work with Seeed CAN module as long as using FlexiTimer2
  - Most inputs are represented (green background on text for Active inputs)
  - 'screen saver' is nothing but a black screen, to prevent burn-in
