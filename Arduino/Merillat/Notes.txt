As of 07/02/2017, need to:
- Alter RxTest software on Uno to respond, making a simulator
  when a jumper or input is set (so no pgm change needed to just log)
- port speed improvements back to RxTest software so we don't lose messages
- CAN module configured to fail off upon lack of comm ???
- GUI:
  - activate Touch functions:
    - touch to wake from 'screen saver' mode
    - touch an Open/Close input request to start sequence?
    - when in Error mode, touch will have list of all nodes and which are OK vs Not
- would be nice:
  - after an open/close cycle, display the time remaining of each state sequenced thru.
    allows to see how close to 'failing' each state is (don't make it too tight)

Done:
- Have a data logger for when tracing thruster activity
  - currently boots at 250kBaud
  - outputs data in CANKing format (thanks Pete!)
  - can request baud rate change, pause/resume (thanks Pete!)
- Fixed consistent timing of CAN message by using 0.4ms FlexiTimer2 to
  constantly check inbound and outbound queues.  Test with professional
  CAN hardware showed shortest message ~0.26ms, but typically 0.44ms+,
  leading to the selection of 0.4ms timer configuration.
- Thruster Tx/Rx accessed via BitObjects, which allow fields too
- Actual state sequence machine for controlling door logic
  - roughed in, using StateMachine.h/cpp
- Confirmed Thruster TX byte order was as expected on the CANBus
- GUI:
  - Appears to work with Seeed CAN module as long as using FlexiTimer2
  - All CAN inputs are represented (green background on text for Active inputs)
  - represent outputs with symbols
  - 'screen saver' is nothing but a black screen, to prevent burn-in
  - Shows current state and standard timer used in that state showing
    when a fault will be generated if the correct inputs aren't seen
