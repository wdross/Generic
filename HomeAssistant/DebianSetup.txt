Setting up Dell Inspiron 1545 with HomeAssistant

Followed Supervised Installation instructions at
  https://community.home-assistant.io/t/installing-home-assistant-supervised-on-debian-10/200253

- The key was after getting Debian itself up and running, to get
  HA installed and kicked of the following script steps where executed:
>>>EOF
sudo -i
apt-get install -y software-properties-common apparmor-utils apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl dbus jq network-manager
systemctl disable ModemManager
systemctl stop ModemManager
curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sh
curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kanga-Who/home-assistant/master/supervised-installer.sh" | bash -s
<<<EOF


Modifications to my system:

Prevent hybernation with the lid closing:
- nano /etc/systemd/logind.conf
- Find HandleLidSwitch and alter to read:
  HandleLidSwitch=ignore

Prevent sleeping/hybernating:
- nano /etc/systemd/sleep.conf
- alter following parameters to be:
  [Sleep]
  AllowSuspend=no
  AllowHibernation=no
  AllowSuspendThenHibernate=no
  AllowHybridSleep=no
