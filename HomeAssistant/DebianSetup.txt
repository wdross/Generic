Setting up Dell Inspiron 1545 with HomeAssistant

Followed Supervised Installation instructions at
  https://community.home-assistant.io/t/installing-home-assistant-supervised-on-debian-10/200253

- The key was after getting Debian itself up and running, to get
  HA installed and kicked off the following script steps where I executed:
>>>EOF
sudo -i
apt-get install -y software-properties-common apparmor-utils apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl dbus jq network-manager
systemctl disable ModemManager
systemctl stop ModemManager
curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sh

# should have installed docker-compose at the same time:
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.12.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)"  -o /usr/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/bin/docker-compose

curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kanga-Who/home-assistant/master/supervised-installer.sh" | bash -s
<<<EOF


This creates a config file at /etc/hassio.json

The systemctl script is found in /usr/sbin/hassio-supervisor and
launches docker with the correct arguments.

The data stored over power cycles is in /usr/share/hassio/
- ${HASSIO_DATA}, and  is mounted as rw
- for which a link to 'hassio' is found in ~ as a reminder

To get rid of "Unsupported system - OS-Agent issues", installed os-agent:
- go to https://github.com/home-assistant/os-agent/releases/latest
- download Asset associated with latest release, of the form *_linux_x86_64.deb:
  i.e. os-agent_1.4.1_linux_x86_64.deb
>> cd ~/Downloads
>> wget https://github.com/home-assistant/os-agent/releases/download/1.4.1/os-agent_1.4.1_linux_x86_64.deb
>> sudo dpkg -i os-agent_1.4.1_linux_x86_64.deb


Modifications to my system:

Prevent hybernation with the lid closing:
- nano /etc/systemd/logind.conf
- Find HandleLidSwitch and alter to read:
  HandleLidSwitch=ignore

Prevent sleeping/hybernating:
- nano /etc/systemd/sleep.conf
- alter following parameters to be:
  [Sleep]
  AllowSuspend=no
  AllowHibernation=no
  AllowSuspendThenHibernate=no
  AllowHybridSleep=no

Introduced pi-hole:
Created folder Generic/HomeAssistant/pi-hole for docker-compose.yml and empty
support folders for data stored over power cycles/restarts.

cd ~/Generic/HomeAssistant/pi-hole
sudo docker-compose up

Log into http://192.168.1.2/admin with password from docker-compose.yml
- Settings -> DNS -> Rate-limiting: was 1000, increase to 10k

Log into R7000 home router
