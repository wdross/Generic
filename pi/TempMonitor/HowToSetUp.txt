The goal of this project is to monitor a "remote" thermometer and
provide a notification (email; SMS) of an over-temperature situation,
specifically for a deep freezer that you might have in a garage and
are not accessing every day.  It also will have local annunciation
via a piezo.

I chose to use a pi zero over an Arduino due to price point:
 . pi zero:               $5.00  https://www.adafruit.com/products/2885
 . USB OTG adapter cable: $2.50  https://www.adafruit.com/products/1099
 . bigger USB WiFi:      $12.95  https://www.adafruit.com/product/1012
 . 5v power supply:       $7.95  https://www.adafruit.com/products/1995
 . 8GB SD micro:          $9.95  https://www.adafruit.com/products/1294
 . Piezo:                 $0.95  https://www.adafruit.com/products/1740
 - breadboard, wire, solder
   Projected costs:      $39.30

During development, it might be necessary to see the screen, so a HDMI
mini to HDMI adapter ($2.95 https://www.adafruit.com/products/2819) could
prove useful.  You'll also need a USB hub if you want a keyboard while
connected to the Wi-Fi.  You can forgo that and use the serial console
by using this https://www.adafruit.com/products/954 USB converter for $9.95.
 

You'll need a distribution of rasbian that runs on your target hardware.
The cool thing is that this could be put on a pi that is running
Kodi/XBMC for your entertainment needs, and can be installed along
side that function.

I chose the DS1631, an i2c device that measure temperature within
0.5C or better.  The datasheet for this device is included in this
project folder for reference.

I used a breadboard that allowed me to make the necessary connections
to a ~5' cable that I ran to my pi.  I re-used an old IDE 40-pin connector
which matches the newer pi 2x20 header interface.

Once the hardware is put together, the proper drivers need to be set up
to enable the Linux drivers to deal with the i2c bus.

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install python-smbus i2c-tools
  sudo nano /etc/modules
