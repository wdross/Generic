Comparing the main (HowToSetUp.txt) pi zero concept:


Arduino Uno Ethernet: $65.00 https://www.adafruit.com/products/418
Piezo
Total project

This has the down side that an Ethernet connection is required
instead of the flexibility of Wi-Fi.


Arduino Yun Wi-Fi: $74.95 https://www.adafruit.com/products/1498
Piezo
Total project

This is comparible to the pi zero option which came in at $39.30
