Generic
=======
A bash script of what I want to see at login to any Linux system
I commonly use.

pantry\ contains a home inventory system built on a mysql database,
allowing to see what items are present, and what items might need
to be purchased the next time I'm at the grocery store.

Arduino\ contains some projects I am attempting

pi\ are projects for raspberry pi's (most noteably the cost effective zero!)
